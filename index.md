# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi, I'm Enigma! I have been an indie game developer since 2020. Check out my projects below!

## Projects

### [Tides of War WWI]
Tides of War is a real-time strategy game set during the Great War. It is inspired by classics such as Age of Empires, mixed with elements from the Anno series.

The game focuses heavily on logistics, resource management and production chains besides the classic RTS combat mechanics. Resource nodes must be captured and held to produce basic resources.
These basic resources can then be further refined into more complex resources used for building and munitions production.

This is my passion project that I one day hope to release on Steam. Everything in the game is made by me, as I'm a solo developer.
